# Skunk-Wordpress-Plugin
The fact that plugins frequently break each other resulting in a busted site is a good reason to avoid Wordpress

// That said...

This is my take on an empty WP plugin that establishes itself in the menu system, creates 3 configuration 
fields in the WP setup table, sets up a custom database table for storing a phone list for text messages

Tries to un-install cleanly.

BEWARE: puts itself high on the left admin menu against WP codex recommendation, because I have never 
had a single client who did not insist upon that.
